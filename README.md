# photo-composition-detector

This repo will be using computer vision techniques on photos focusing on photo composition. This is inspired by my dissertation work using the Golden Spiral for visual privacy scoring. 

Photo composition is the arrangement of visual elements within a photograph's frame. The photo's composition can influence how people look at your photo; this can direct the eye to an object or subject. A few techniques this repo will look at are: 
- Fill the frame
- Rule of Thirds
- Golden Spiral

This repo will also look at image bounding and segmentation.
